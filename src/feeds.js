// The source list. One row per feed: [outlet, bias(-2 left .. +2 right), url, publisher?].

// `publisher` is optional and defaults to `outlet`. It exists so two feeds from the same
// newsroom (NY Post and NY Post Opinion) don't get counted as two independent outlets when
// weighing how many voices cover a story — that inflated the right side of every bias bar
// and could suppress a blindspot flag by making a one-newsroom story look corroborated.
